# ck2debug mod

> A mod to help modders troubleshoot their CK2 mods.

This mod adds:
- Extra logging via on_actions of what is happening in the game, so that there's more useful info to game.log.
- Shortcuts via targeted decisions on characters, titles and settlements, in order to reproduce some situations simpler and faster than using [console commands](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Console_commands), or some things which are not possible via the console.

It is compatible with any other mod. But as it changes the checksum, don't forget to disable the mod when calculating the actual mod checksum.
